    <h1>Infected Mushroom</h1>

    <p>
    Infected Mushroom was formed in 1996 as a Psytrance duo in Haifa, Israel by Erez Eisen and Amit Duvdevani. Many of their followers know them best from dancefloors at outdoor gatherings and festivals all over the world.
    Over the course of more than two decades Infected Mushroom has become one of the most well known names in electronic dance music. Eisen and Duvdevani are both classically trained musicians. Their classical roots breathe an orchestration of complexity into their compositions, giving them a distinctive sound that has infected the minds of millions, and inspired countless numbers of electronic musicians to embark upon their own journey of sonic wizardry.
    Infected Mushroom, now based in Los Angeles, have expanded their live shows to include vocals, 'live' instruments, and mesmerizing multimedia visuals. Their music has also been featured on movie soundtracks and video game
    scores.
